                        <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
                            as of 2018[1], up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs)
                            and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)

                        <p>
                            Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced.
                            Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers. Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages. Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate
                            intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet

                        <p>
                            Sushi is an ancient food dish from the Tang dynasty. It has always consisted of fermented fish and rice, and the word sushi means something that tastes sour. Contrary to popular opinion, Sushi does not mean ‘raw fish.’ It means ‘vinegar rice.’ Sushi has
                            evolved into an artful, unique dining experience. In its earliest form, dried fish was placed between two pieces of vinegared rice as a way of preserving it. The nori (seaweed) was added later as a way to keep one’s fingers
                            from getting sticky. The Japanese word su means vinegar, and shi is from meshi, the Japanese word for rice, hence sushi is vinegared rice, Now, the term is used to describe a finger-size piece of raw fish or shellfish on a
                            bed of rice or simply the consumption of raw fish in the Japanese style. This can be eaten as is, or is often dipped into shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) and then eaten. Great care should be taken in making the dish and the many
                            methods of preparing the food indicate the importance of appearance to the educated consumer. Sushi is a work of art as much as a food, and while it is now available in a western ‘quick and easy’ serving style, the traditional
                            ways are far from that.
